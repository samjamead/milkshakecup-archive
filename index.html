    <h2>Welcome from the Defending Champion</h2>
    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Milkshake Cup is the most prestigious event in the amateur golfing calendar. Strictly invite only, you should feel honoured to have been selected for this year's event. Winning the Milkshake Cup is one of my greatest achievements; lifting that famous trophy and being awarded the green waterproof jacket in McDonald's car park is truly a feeling like no other.</p>
    <p>Short drives, aggressive chipping, and slow bobbling putts are the key to success on these challenging courses. May the odds be ever in your favour!</p>
