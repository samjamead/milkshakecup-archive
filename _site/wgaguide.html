  <div class="container">

    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Westcountry Golf Acadamy is Mid Devon's best kept secret. An imacculately kept nine-hole par-three course, the WGA is more challenging than it first appears. Water on nearly every hole keeps the mind focused from the tee, and slow but true greens require attention while putting. Don't be fooled by the fact that several holes have similar yardages; you'll certainly want a full bag of clubs.</p>

    <h3>Getting there</h3>
    <p>The course is a seven minute walk or a one minute drive from Tiverton Parkway railway station. Chuck this in Google Maps: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/WGA+Golf+Course/@50.9206602,-3.3633439,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x1a2ccb920f8f3382!2sWestcountry+Golf+Academy+Ltd!8m2!3d50.9206602!4d-3.3633439!3m4!1s0x486d94565081bed7:0xe0149895358e0375!8m2!3d50.9188997!4d-3.3663332" target="_blank">WGA Golf Course, EX16 7EH</a></p>

    <div class="hole__by__hole">
      
        <h2><span>Hole 1</span> &ndash; The Tarn</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/1.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>A very nice looking hole, and a wonderful start to the competition. Water short, water right. Bunker protects the green on the left. Play for the front edge and enjoy an easy opening par!</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 2</span> &ndash; Grand Oak</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/2.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>Probably the same club that you took on the first hole, but this is slightly downhill, so plays a little shorter.</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 3</span> &ndash; Foxes Drift</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/3.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>The longest hole on the course, most can safely ignore the bunker on the right as it's a long way short of the green. Out of bounds left, out of bounds long.</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 4</span> &ndash; Willows</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/4.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>Played entirely over water, there's only about 6 feet of saftey short of the front of the green. Anything right is safe, but do shout fore if there's anyone on the 6th green!</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 5</span> &ndash; Rabbit Copse</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/5.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>A narrow hole, with a lateral water hazard all the way up the left, and bunkers protecting the green. Accuracy here is extremly important!</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 6</span> &ndash; Lakeside</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/6.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>The hardest hole on the course, the green is extremely well protected by a lake. It is possible to lay up down the left hand side, but make sure you carry the stream that feeds the lake.</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 7</span> &ndash; The Burn</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/7.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>A tricky three-tierd green is protected by a wee burn at the front of the geen. It's possible to putt into the water hazard...</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 8</span> &ndash; Badgers Run</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/8.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>The shortest and easiest hole on the course, just a flick with a wedge – or a nine iron at most. A dry lateral hazard awaits a thinned tee shot, so keep your head down and swing through the ball. Long is safe.</p>
      
        <h2><span>Hole 9</span> &ndash; Tuberfield</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/wga/9.jpg" alt="WGA Hole" />
        <p>The finishing hole plays at least a club longer than its yardage. Anything right is wet, so play straight and low into the two-tierd green, and soak up the roars of the crowd as you walk up to the putting surface.</p>

    <h3>Competition Interpretations of Local Rules</h3>
    <p>For some reason the course distinguishes between water hazards and lateral water hazards. We're going to simplify things and treat them the same.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water Hazards</strong> &ndash; Take a drop from knee height within two club lengths, no nearer the hole, as close to the line of entry as possible. If the hazard was between you and the hole when you hit the ball in the water, your drop must leave the hazard between you and the green. The drop counts as one penalty stroke (so if you land in the water off the tee, the drop is your second shot, and you'll play your third from your dropped ball).</li>
      <li><strong>Out of Bounds Off the Tee</strong> &ndash; Take a drop from knee height within two club lengths, no nearer the hole, as close to where the ball went out of bounds as possible. One stroke penalty (so you'll play your third shot from where you drop a new ball).</li>
      <li><strong>Staked Trees</strong> &ndash; If your ball or stance come within two clublengths of a staked tree, you must take a free drop no nearer the hole at the nearest point of relief (i.e. the closest point that you can get two clublengths away from the staked tree, in any direction, as long as it is no nearer the hole).</li>
    </ul>
